## Project Description
In general everybody knows tht there is still a gender gap in entrepreneurship worldwide even though several studies actually demonstate the positive impact of female entrepreneur on economic growth and development. I decided to dive deeper into the data of female versus male entrepreneurs and see how the current distribution looks like, as well as to find out what could be factors that support or rather influence female entrepreneurship.

## Question & Hypotheses
* How does the gender gap in entrepreneurship look like regarding the moste recent data?
* Which countries do especially great, which aren't that great?
* What kind of factors support or inhibit female entrepreneurship?

## Dataset
For the analysis I used the publicly available data from the World Bank Data. The data about female & male entrepreneurs can be found here. Also I looked at the Women Business and the Law Index data, which is also available on the World Bank Data website.

When downloading the data I realized that there were a lot of countries within the dataset without any numbers. I had to remove a few countries were there was no data for the most recent year as I wanted to especially focus on that. Furthermore I had merge the Women and Business and the Law Index data with the entrepreneurship data.

## Workflow
The following workflow was implemented:

1. Choosing the dataset
2. Deciding in the focus for the project
3. Data cleaning and wrangling
4. Analysis
5. Conclusions
6. Visualization & Presentation

## Analysis

## Conclusions
The gender gap remains high around many economies around the world. The income of the country has a higher influence on the proportion of female entrepreneurship than legal disparities. This suggests that women indeed have the opportunity to build businesses and are not held back by legal disparities. Still, there must be other factors that have an influence on female entrepreneurship as for example education or access to financial institutions. 

## Limitations
There is an overall lack of data with regards to female entrepreneurship. That makes it hard to look for example at the share of female entrepreneurship over time (not all countries provide data every year). More research must be done to have a more detailed picture about that topic.
